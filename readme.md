Sublime Text 2 Completions for CodeIgniter
==========================================

Ever get sick of typing things like `$this->load->view` or `$this->security->sanitize_filename` when building your CI sites and apps? Well I've gathered together all the functions from the [CodeIgniter User Guide] Class Reference so you no longer have to.

Installation
------------

I'm guessing you've already got a copy of [Sublime Text 2].

**Linux**

Download the PHP-Codeigniter.sublime_completions file up above, and drop it in your *~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/PHP/* folder. Should work immediately.

**Windows & Mac**

You're going to need to drop it into wherever your Sublime Text config folder is. I haven't used either OS for a couple of months, but seeing as you're clever enough to understand Git and code in PHP, I don't think you'll have too much trouble,

Usage
-----

Just start typing and up will pop the CodeIgniter functions in question.

What's missing
--------------

I've included every CodeIgniter function I could find, but if I've missed anything out, I'd appreciate it if you let me know.
